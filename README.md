Create a frontend only webapp to manage a group of users and that also displays a graph of logged in users. The page should come pre populated with 5 users and the webapp should cater for a maximum of 10 users. Users must have at least the following properties: fullname, email, id & active. On startup all the users should be active.
The interface should;
- display a list of all of the users
- display a toggle button for each user to log them in/out
- allow basic CRUD functionality on each user
- display a graph (SVG if possible) that displays the current number of logged in users that updates every 5 seconds
Post your code to your GitHub account for us to review.
We use VueJS / SVG quite heavily so using these technologies will earn you bonus points.
